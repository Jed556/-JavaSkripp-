# Discord.js Bot
## Disclaimer
Command handlers used are imported from this [repository](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Discord-js-handler-slash-Commands) and modified by me to suit the needs of JavaSkripp's commands. <br/>

## Features
This is a custom slash command based discord.js bot with over 105 slash commands <br/>
This repository is only for updates and submission of issues <br/>
The main JavaSkripp repository is set to Private for security reasons <br/>

## Usage
Use a prefix based command first (ex. ```!help```) before using a slash command after the bot boots ([Issue](https://github.com/users/Jed556/projects/1#card-68807832)) <br/>
Use ```!help``` or ```/info help``` in Discord to list all commands <br/>

## Updates and Issues
Updates and issues of JavaSkripp are available in this [project](https://github.com/users/Jed556/projects/1). <br/>
